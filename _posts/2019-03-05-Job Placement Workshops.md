We had our 4th job placement workshop at the academy. I really like the format the school is preparing us for the job hunt that awaits us after graduation. 

So far, we had the below workshops:
* How NYCDSA will help us in finding a job
* How to build a great resume (my resume link is on the left if interested in seeing mine)
* How to write quality emails, cover letters and thank you letters

I worked in business development for the last 9-10 years, so when it comes to writing intro emails or thank you letters, I'm comfortable with it. The secret is around respecting the receiver's time and having a grasp on the value you're providing for the other person OR if you'll be asking for something, coming up with a good reason why you need that specific thing you're asking for. Format is simple:

* A catchy subject line. Not a "Hello" or "Hi from blah blah". You can even write "Subject: A quick request" or "Subject: Coffee chat re: data science". Make it short, to the point and related to the email you're sending.

Ok, so now you have the subject locked in. What about the body of the email?
* This is who I am - 1 sentence
* This is the summary of why I'm reaching out to you - 1 sentence
* This is the reason I need help - People respond to requests more positively if you provide them a reason. 1-2 sentences
* The details of the request - 1-2 sentences
* Thank you/regards/much appreciated/look forward to hearing back, etc..

One thing I feel like a lot of people don't think about is that many people read emails on their cell phones. Now the email you're sending from your laptop might look good & short on your email client, but if the receipient sees this email on their smart phone, it may look like 100 pages long. Think about the last time you received a long email that spanned pages and pages, how did this make you feel? Now multiply that feeling with 100. That's how executives feel on a daily basis.

Also consider that people receive 100s of emails every day. What makes your email so important compared to other emails the receipient is receiving throughout the day? Think about this hard and then compose your email.

There are a lot other things to think about, such as the time you send the email. Based on my experiences, emails that are sent late Sunday nights or very early in the morning, before 7a, gets the most reads, at least from senior executives. Those are the times that people aren't bombarding them with phone calls or they're stuck in meetings. Those are the times the executives are getting ready for the work and if you can send an email with a catchy subject line, it will probably be looked at. Now, will it be responded? Most likely not, but the chance to receive a response is higher. That's at least was the case in my own experience. 

So, to summarise: Send short and to the point emails, avoid generic filler words, and make everything very clear. Don't try to sugarcoat things. Write the email, read it before sending it, then try to shorten it. Once that's done, do it again. And again. You get the point hopefully.
