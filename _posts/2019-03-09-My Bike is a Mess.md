I keep thinking about the format of this website. Do I keep it professional and dedicate it to data science, or do I make it more of a personal branding webpage where I talk about a lot of things as well as data science while showcasing my projects. I'm guessing I'll have a better idea as I put more content here. It's a problem for the future Yuce, no rush.

The topic today is my motorcycle. I ride a beautiful 2006 matte black Ducati Monster S2R800. She's my love. She's my therapy every morning and night. But, I've been ignoring it a bit due to my schedule. So, the plan today is to get it washed and then do some maintenance items on it to get it back to it's former glory. Right now the bike is covered in salt, needs an oil change, a chain adjustment and couple other small things.

The plan is to make my way to the bike wash in Astoria, while getting it washed go have a breakfast bbq at a friend's place nearby, then pick up the bike and head to the Autozone to pick up some deep cleaning/polishing items. I already have the other parts like tools or oils to do my own maintenance.

All this should take me 3-4 hours total but it's worth it. I need some distraction from all the studying, so it'll be a win-win. The clarity I feel in my mind when I finish working on my bike is something that I love. Refreshes me completely!
