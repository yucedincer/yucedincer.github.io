Finally it's the day where I finally have time to create my own website. I have so many ideas in my mind but I'm starting simple since I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this website yet due to school & project work. Priorities are on coding and making sure my homeworks/projects are completed on time and they're done good.

Fingers crossed that I'll be able to represent my work & personality well in this website. I will be posting regularly with either some thoughts I have, code I'm working on or stuff that I've read/watched recently. 
(if you want to see my code asap and not interested in my writing, check out my github profile.. link on the left;) )

I'm looking forward to adding more content!

P.S: My first name is Rifat, but friends and family call me by my middle name, Yuce - pronounced U.J. If you're here, then you already took the first step to be friends with me (or hire me). Either way, call me U.J :)
