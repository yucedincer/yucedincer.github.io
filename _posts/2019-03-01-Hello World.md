Finally it's the day where I get to sit down and create my own website with some cool stuff whether it's life in general or work. So many ideas in my mind but starting simple since I don't have a ton of time to dedicate to this website yet. Priorities are on coding and making sure my homeworks/projects are completed on time and they're done good! 

Fingers crossed that I'll be able to represent my personality well in this website. I will be posting regularly with either code I'm working on or stuff that I've read/watched recently. 

Should be fun!

P.S: My first name is Rifat, but friends and family call me by my middle name, which is Yuce - pronounced U.J. If you're here, then you already took the first step to be friends with me (or hire me). Either way, call me U.J :)
