Today was the capstone project declaration deadline at school. I was originally supposed to be part of a group where we would get data from a video streaming platform, a real business, to create a recommender system. However that failed, leaving me to my moonshot idea of building a reinforcement learning project for Formula 1 pitstop lap selection optimization. 

However, I was suggested that this might be a project that will require significant time commitment (we have two weeks to complete the project) and that I should pick from one of the projects that our five partner companies pitched to us. It's pretty cool if you ask me, these cool companies are coming to our school and asking us to be a part of their business. So, I marked my preferences on a shared Google Doc, and we'll see which project I will land on. All are great projects, but one has my heart. Fingers crossed!
