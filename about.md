I spent the last 9 years doing business development for AT&T, Salesforce & HackerRank working with companies that ranged from small startups to large enterprises by partnering with their C suite and solving business challenges with technology. 

I'm looking forward to utilizing my business domain knowledge in combination with technical skills to help companies generate more revenue as well as become more efficient.
